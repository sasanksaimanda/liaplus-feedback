# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# User Feedback System

A full-stack application for collecting and managing user feedback.

## Features

- Submit feedback through a user-friendly form
- Categorize feedback (suggestions, bug reports, feature requests)
- View all feedback in an interactive dashboard
- Filter and sort feedback by various parameters
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm (v6 or newer)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/feedback-system
   PORT=5000
   ```
   Note: If using MongoDB Atlas, replace the URI with your connection string.

4. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server will run on http://localhost:5000

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. Navigate to the homepage to submit feedback
2. Use the navigation menu to access the dashboard
3. In the dashboard, use filters and search to find specific feedback

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit new feedback
- `GET /api/feedback` - Retrieve all feedback with optional filters

## Project Architecture

### Data Flow

1. User submits feedback through the React form
2. Form data is sent to the Express backend API
3. Backend validates and stores the data in MongoDB
4. Dashboard requests data from the backend with filters
5. Backend retrieves filtered data and sends it to the frontend
6. Dashboard displays the feedback data to the user

### Scalability Considerations

- The application uses a RESTful API design for easy scaling
- MongoDB provides horizontal scaling capabilities as data grows
- Backend is designed to handle multiple concurrent requests
- Frontend uses efficient rendering with React's virtual DOM

## Future Improvements

- User authentication for admin dashboard access
- Feedback analytics and reporting features
- Email notifications for new feedback
- Pagination for large datasets
- Comment/response functionality for feedback items
